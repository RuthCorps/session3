#Option 1: Lexical decision task
#In a lexical decision task, the participant is presented with a word for a given period of time, and asked to respond whether they think it is a real word (or not). Typically, participants will respond faster to high-frequency words than to low-frequency words. We are going to build an experiment that can do this. You can use the stimuli you created for session 2b (HF/LF/NW); but if you did not manage to create the stimuli, or do not like the result, all the stimuli are also in the repository of session 3.
#We have high frequency, low frequency, and non-word stimuli. For the first version, we will make a demo that presents a couple of auditory stimuli regardless of the condition. After making an experiment that can simply present auditory stimuli and record the response, you can think of a way to neatly randomize the three conditions.
#Key elements of the experiment:
#-        Read the csv with stimulus information
#-        Present an auditory stimulus
#-        Fixation cross-screen
#-        Decision screen
#-        Clock
#-        Keys to press
#-        Record the response & timing
